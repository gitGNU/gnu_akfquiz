The files with the extension .ub are raw sound files.
They are encoded in Mono, 22050Hz, 8-Bit (unsigned Byte, thus .ub).

If you have the program sox installed, you can play them like this:
 $ play -r 22050 *.ub

You can use sox to convert soundfiles from other formats:
 $ sox mysound.wav -r 22050 -c 1 introsnd.ub resample

It is a good idea to sample the sounds with a higher quality first and
resample them afterwards.

The soundfiles 
errorsnd.ub, infosnd.ub, introsnd.ub, rightsnd.ub, wrongsnd.ub, 
neutralsnd.ub
of the original AKFQuiz package are put into the Public Domain.
