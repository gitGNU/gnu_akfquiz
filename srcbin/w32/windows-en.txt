AKFQuiz for Windows

PLEASE UNINSTALL OLDER VERSIONS OF AKFQUIZ BEFORE YOU 
INSTALL A NEW VERSION!


DESCRIPTION

The package AKFQuiz lets you easily make your own quiz games, learning
exercises or psychotests. These can be used with grquiz in a graphical
environment, with diaquiz (not included) as a simple GUI program or
with scrquiz on the text-console. There is also a line oriented
variant, linequiz, which can be used as a backend.

A CGI-variant, cgiquiz (not included), can be installed on a Web 
server to offer exercises via Internet or a local network. There is 
also an exam-mode in cgiquiz to use it for serious exams.

Or you can use mkquiz, which generates an HTML-file for to use with 
JavaScript. Those can then be published using any deliberate web-space 
provider.

The complete AKFQuiz-package is available for GNU/Linux. 


other hints:

If you want to print out a quiz-form, please do it using your web-
browser. There is special code in the HTML-file that suppresses the 
buttons and stuff from being printed out.

A detailed description about how AKFQuiz-files are built up can be 
found in the start-menu under programs/AKFQuiz/Documentation.

The example-files are very self-explaining, but they don't show each 
and every possibility offered by the programs.


quizstat:

quizstat shows some simple statistics about quizfiles. It is not
really  needed. If you want to use quizstat anyway, you need a nawk
(new awk) interpreter like mawk or gawk. A nawk interpreter is included
in Posix compatiblity environments like MSYS or Cygwin.

You can get a standalone awk there:

The most actual version of AKFQuiz can be found on the Internet:

For the installer for Windows I use 
NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)
