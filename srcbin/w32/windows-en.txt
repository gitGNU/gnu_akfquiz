AKFQuiz for Windows

PLEASE UNINSTALL OLDER VERSIONS OF AKFQUIZ BEFORE YOU 
INSTALL A NEW VERSION!


DESCRIPTION

The package AKFQuiz lets you easily make your own quiz games, learning
exercises or psychotests. These can be used with grquiz in a graphical
environment, or with scrquiz on the text-console. There is also a line
oriented variant, linequiz, which can be used as a backend.

Or you can use mkquiz, which generates an HTML-file for to use with
JavaScript. Those can then be published using any deliberate web-space 
provider.

The version for GNU/Linux contains further software.


other hints:

If you want to print out a quiz-form, please do it using your web-
browser. There is special code in the HTML-file that suppresses the 
buttons and stuff from being printed out.

A detailed description about how AKFQuiz-files are built up can be 
found in the start-menu under programs/AKFQuiz/Documentation.

The example-files are very self-explaining, but they don't show each 
and every possibility offered by the programs.

You can get the latest version of AkFQuiz from the internet:

For the installer for Windows I use 
NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System)
