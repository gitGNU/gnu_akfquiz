INSTALLATION

With binary packages:

You need the main package and the package with the binaries for your 
system. For example:

akfquiz-4.2.1.main.tar.gz
akfquiz-4.2.1.bin.Linux.x86.tar.gz

Unpack them in the same directory. Go into the newly created directory
"akfquiz/srcbin/" and play around with the binaries there.

To install everything, go into the directory "akfquiz/" and run 
"./configure" and have a look at the settings it shows. If you don't 
like the settings, use the parameters for configure, as described below.
Then become root, go into the directory "akfquiz/" and type "make install" 
and eventually "make install-cgi".


COMPILING:

If you cannot or don't want to use a binary package, you have to compile 
the programs yourself. 

Compiling with Free Pascal (FPC) 2.0.0 or newer:

You need the main package and SDL-1.2 has to be  installed on your 
system.

Unpack the main packackage. Go into the newly created directory 
akfquiz/ and type

  ./configure
  make 
  make clean

After that, it is ready to use, as described above.


Compiling with GNU Pascal (GPC) 20030303 or newer.

To compile grquiz with GPC, either the libSDL-1.2 or the GRX library 
with GPC support enabled must be installed. 
When grquiz cannot be compiled, that error is ignored in the Makefile. 
The program gtkquizchooser cannot be compiled with GPC.

type

  ./configure --with-gpc
  make 
  make clean

If you have the GRX library installed, you should enter
"./configure --with-grx", but libSDL should be preferred.

After that, it is ready to use, as described above.


Using configure:
The configure script accepts the following parameters:

--help            shows a short help
--prefix=         where to install
--cgipath=        where to install the CGI binary
--variant=        Variant name
--with-*          compiler to use [*]
--arch=           CPU architecture (just a name for making packages)
--sys=            system (just a name for making packages)
--enable-exam=no  disables the exam-mode
--disable-exam    disables the exam-mode

[*] the compiler may be
--with-fpc  - Free Pascal 2.0 or newer
--with-gpc  - GNU Pascal 20030303 or newer with libSDL
--with-grx  - GNU Pascal 20030303 or newer with GRX
--with-xarm - Free Pascal Cross-Compiler for Linux on ARM
--with-xw32 - Free Pascal Cross-Compiler for Windows 
              (don't use it directly on Windows)


Windows Users:

The configure script needs a Bourne Shell. It is tested with MSys and 
MinGW as environment. Use "make windows". Do not use "make install" or 
"make install-cgi".

linequiz       - interactive quiz in command-line mode [2]
diaquiz        - interactive quiz for X (needs Xdialog)

    To use it with SVGALIB it must be installed setuid root.
[2] linequiz is meant as backend program
