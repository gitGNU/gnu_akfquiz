AKFQuiz 4.0

In version 4.0 of AKFQuiz a lot has changed so that old quiz files have 
to be rewritten.

Comments are introduced with the hash sign (#) just like in earlier 
versions. But in contrast to earlier versions it must stand alone in 
the line, it can no longer be behind keywords or text. Therefor you 
can use the hash sign inside of texts now. That is especially useful 
if you want to embed HTML-code (see GPL-Quiz).

Un*x only:
If you want to make the quiz executable on Un*x compatible systems you 
have to write the following in the very first line:
#!/usr/bin/env akfquiz
This "akfquiz" is a script which tries to start the best quiz-program 
for your actual environment.


You should put the term AKFQuiz at the beginning of the quiz-file 
(after the #! line if you use it).

The format for answers has also changed. The points value is no longer 
on a line for itself, but you have to write it in front of the answer 
on the same line. Long answer texts can spawn more than just one line 
in this version, when you put a backslash (\) at the end of the line 
when the text has not ended yet.

example:

  question:
  The question can have more than one line.
  Paragraphs are also possible.
  .
  Can answers also have more than one line?

  0 No
  1 yes, but you have to mask the end of the line \
  with a backslash

You can have more than just 9 possible answers.
And there are new keywords "hint:" or "remark:".
